Rahman, 35, who attended the festival for the first time, came to learn more about Japanese culture.“I have been waiting to attend the festival here since returning from Japan in 2019 but due to Covid-19 restrictions, I was unable to do so until now.“We also purchased yukatas to better experience the festivities,” said Amru, who came with his wife Siti Nor Wani, 31, and one-year-old daughter Aina Nur Ammara.Self-employed Mike Woon Kay Ven, 25, said he loved the music and dances.“My friends and I have been coming here for several years and decided to join the celebrations again now that it’s allowed.“This year’s celebrations also seem to be more organised, which makes it merrier for all,” said Woon, who came with his friends from Cheras.It was also a nostalgic reunion for real estate planner Gerene Chen who joined the celebration for a second time after attending the festival at the same venue 30 years ago.“It’s great to experience this again with similar vibes from my first celebration still being felt,” she added.Japanese Ambassador to Malaysia Katsuhiko Takahashi said the annual cultural event began as an effort to promote and strengthen ties between Japan and Malaysia.“The celebrations this year are particularly significant as they exemplify Malaysia and Japan’s togetherness in overcoming challenges, including Covid-19.“This also proves to be a fine testimony of the cordial bilateral relations enjoyed by our two countries,” he told a press conference.He noted that Japan was Malaysia’s fourth largest trading partner and third largest investor.“Some 1,500 companies are operating here in Malaysia, with a significant number in Selangor. This creates job opportunities alongside contributing towards the economy of the state and nation,” he said.This year also marked the 65th anniversary of the formation of diplomatic ties between the
